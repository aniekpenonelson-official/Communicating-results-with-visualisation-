# Communicating-results-with-visualisation-
Applying visualisation best practices to generate appealing visual insights to Ford Gobike dataset
DESCRIPTION 

Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.

In the file "Exploratory visualization" , I make use of Python visualization libraries to systematically explore Ford Gobike dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In the second file "Explanatory  visualization" , I produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships discovered in Exploratory visualisation notebook. The primary method of conveying findings is through transforming exploratory visualizations from the first part (exploratory visualisation) into polished, explanatory visualizations.

HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN PROJECT 

In this project, I uses Python 3 to design and complete through the Jupyter Notebook's IDE. I use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following are libraries used to complete this project :

NumPy

pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

USE OF PROJECT 

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.

Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.
